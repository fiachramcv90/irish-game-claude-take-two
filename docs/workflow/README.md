## Quick Start

1. **Phase Templates**: Use templates in `phase-templates/` for each development phase
2. **Agent Roles**: Review `agent-roles.md` for detailed responsibilities
3. **Interactions**: Follow patterns defined in `interaction-patterns.md`
4. **Decisions**: Document all major decisions in `decision-log.md`
