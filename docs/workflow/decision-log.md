## [D006] - Development Architecture Technology Stack - FINALIZED
**Date**: 2024-08-29  
**Status**: ✅ Approved  
**Deciders**: React Developer Agent, Project Orchestrator Agent  
**Context**: Final technology stack selection for React-based game development

#### Options Considered
1. **Vite + Context API**: Fast build, simple state management
2. **Create React App + Redux Toolkit**: Traditional setup, robust state
3. **Next.js + Zustand**: Full-stack capability, lightweight state

#### Decision
**Chosen**: **Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Context API + CSS Modules**  
**Rationale**: 
- Vite provides 5-10x faster development experience than webpack
- Context API sufficient for game state complexity (not enterprise-level)
- TypeScript provides excellent Irish character and vocabulary type safety
- CSS Modules prevent style conflicts while supporting Irish typography
- Smaller bundle size aligns with mobile performance requirements

**Technical Specifications**:
- Build tool: Vite 5+
- State management: Context API + useReducer pattern
- Styling: CSS Modules + CSS Custom Properties for Irish theming
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- Performance target: <500KB initial bundle, <3s load time

## [D007] - Game Mechanics and Difficulty System
**Date**: 2024-08-29  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: Game Logic Agent, UI/UX Designer Agent, Content Specialist Agent  
**Context**: Core game mechanics and educational progression design

#### Decision
**Chosen**: **Adaptive Difficulty with Multi-Factor Scoring System**  
**Rationale**: 
- 5 difficulty levels provide clear progression path
- Multi-factor scoring (speed + accuracy + streak) encourages balanced learning
- Adaptive progression keeps players in optimal challenge zone
- Hint system supports different learning styles and difficulties

**Implementation**: 
- Base scoring: 100 points + speed/accuracy/streak bonuses
- Difficulty multipliers: 1.0x (Beginner) to 2.0x (Advanced)
- Automatic difficulty adjustment based on performance metrics
- 3-tier hint system: Visual, cultural context, elimination

**Educational Integration**:
- Vocabulary complexity scales with difficulty level
- Cultural context depth increases with progression
- Time pressure introduced at intermediate levels
- Achievement system encourages mastery over speed

## [D008] - Asset Management and Cultural Validation Strategy
**Date**: 2024-08-29  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: Asset Manager Agent, Content Specialist Agent, Project Orchestrator  
**Context**: Image sourcing, cultural authenticity, and performance optimization

#### Decision
**Chosen**: **3-Tier Cultural Validation with Performance-First Optimization**  
**Rationale**: 
- Cultural authenticity critical for educational credibility
- Performance optimization essential for mobile learning scenarios
- Multi-source strategy reduces dependency risk
- Professional validation ensures cultural appropriateness

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Sources**: 70% free (Unsplash, Pexels), 20% Irish cultural organizations, 10% premium
- **Validation**: Automated → Educator review → Native speaker approval
- **Performance**: WebP → JPEG → PNG fallbacks, <50KB target per image
- **Organization**: Systematic naming, metadata management, responsive variants

**Cultural Standards**:
- Modern Irish cultural context preferred over traditional stereotypes
- Diverse family representations included
- Authentic Irish food and cultural elements where appropriate
- Tourist cliché imagery (leprechauns, excessive shamrocks) avoided

**Context**: React component organization and state management approach

#### Decision
**Chosen**: **Feature-Based Component Architecture with Context Composition**  
**Rationale**: 
- Feature-based organization scales better than component-type organization
- Multiple contexts prevent state management complexity
- Custom hooks encapsulate complex logic for reusability
- Smart/Presentational pattern maintains clear separation of concerns

**Architecture Patterns**:
- **Contexts**: GameContext, ContentContext, UserContext, ThemeContext
- **Custom Hooks**: useGameLogic, useIrishContent, useAccessibility
- **Component Pattern**: Container (smart) + Presentational (dumb) separation
- **State Management**: useReducer for complex state, useState for simple UI state

**Performance Optimizations**:
- React.memo for expensive renders
- useCallback for stable references
- Code splitting by feature/category
- Progressive loading for Irish vocabulary content
