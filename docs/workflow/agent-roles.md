## Agent Collaboration Principles

### Communication Standards
- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute updates facilitated by Project Orchestrator
- **Handoff Protocols**: Structured deliverable transfers between agents
- **Review Gates**: Multi-agent reviews before phase progression
- **Documentation**: All decisions and processes recorded by Documentation Agent

### Quality Gates
- Each agent has defined deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Multi-agent review required for phase transitions
- Continuous integration and testing throughout development
- Final sign-off required from QA Agent and Project Orchestrator
