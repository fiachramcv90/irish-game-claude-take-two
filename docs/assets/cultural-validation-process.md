## 3-Tier Validation System Implementation

Based on our Phase 2 planning, we're implementing a comprehensive 3-tier cultural validation system for all Irish vocabulary images and content.

### Tier 1: Automated Cultural Appropriateness Screening ✅

#### Implementation: Automated Checklist System

**Checklist Criteria** (Must pass ALL items):
```json
{
  "culturalAppropriateness": {
    "avoidsSterotypes": {
      "noLeprechauns": true,
      "noExcessiveShamrocks": true,
      "noTouristCliches": true,
      "noOffensiveImagery": true
    },
    "modernIrishContext": {
      "contemporarySettings": "preferred",
      "balancesTraditionalModern": true,
      "respectfulRepresentation": true
    },
    "visualQuality": {
      "clearSubject": true,
      "appropriateBackground": true,
      "professionalQuality": true,
      "suitableForChildren": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Automated Scoring Algorithm**:
```typescript
interface Tier1ValidationResult {
  imageId: string;
  passed: boolean;
  score: number; // 1-5 scale
  issues: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
}

const validateTier1 = (imageData: ImageMetadata): Tier1ValidationResult => {
  let score = 5;
  const issues: string[] = [];
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  
  // Check for stereotypical elements
  if (containsStereotypes(imageData.description)) {
    score -= 2;
    issues.push("Contains potential Irish stereotypes");
    recommendations.push("Consider alternative imagery");
  }
  
  // Verify cultural context
  if (!hasAppropriateCulturalContext(imageData)) {
    score -= 1;
    recommendations.push("Add cultural context notes");
  }
  
  // Check technical quality
  if (imageData.qualityRating < 4) {
    score -= 1;
    issues.push("Technical quality below standards");
  }
  
  return {
    imageId: imageData.id,
    passed: score >= 3,
    score,
    issues,
    recommendations
  };
};
```
